ITK Plugins

What it is
----------

This project aims to provide plugins wrapping functionality in ITK for
popular applications such as Slicer and ParaView.

How it works
------------

ITK filters are described in a compact JSON file. Source code for
plugins is generated automatically with utility programs in this
project. The approach was inspired from the SimpleITK project
(www.simpleitk.org).
